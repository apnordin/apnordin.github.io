# Professional Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a simple Bootstrap page which provides some personal and professional information about me. The site itself is not intended to demonstrate my professional capabilities, but rather to provide an easy-to-navigate showcase of a select few of my projects.

This page uses Stylish Portfolio by startbootstrap.com as a jumping off point for portfolio layout. License included.

This page is hosted by GitHubPages. You can access it [here](https://apnordin.github.io/).
