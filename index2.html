        <h3 class="mb-3">About Me</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">
          I am a full-stack developer using a sales background to build web
          applications that are both attuned to the user's needs and intuitive
          to their user experience. I recently earned a certificate in full
          stack development from UNC-Chapel Hill, honing my skills in HTML5,
          CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and SQL, while specifically focusing on
          the MERN stack to build full-scale REACT applications. I'm a creative
          problem-solver, skilled at understanding the user's needs and
          translating them into real-world deliverables.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          In a previous career, I worked in progressive roles in Medical Device
          Sales, using my background in Economics and people-focused approach to
          bring value to customers with creative problem-solving solutions.
          After evaluating my career priorities, I've decided to focus on
          delivering tangible solutions to problems through programming. I'm
          seeking a role as a web developer at a company where I can showcase my
          skills and continue to grow in a challenging, fast-paced environment.
